**About the Research:** The aim of this research project was to develop a creative application to add to the knowledge of how interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) can be used in the creative process. To achieve this, an application was developed from two existing codebases, one of an interactive evolutionary model and the other incorporating a traditional drawing method. Creative practitioners were asked to trial this application to study both its automation and interactive aspect, allowing them to explore the evolutionary model’s parameters and its creative output in tandem with traditional drawings, iterating between the two. The emphasis was on the collaborative approach between the user and the model rather than the automation of the computer’s evolutionary abilities allowing users to retain some control and adapt the model to their individual workflows. Here is the research paper:

**About the Application:** The interactive model was inspired by <a href="https://nbenko1.github.io/#/" target="_blank">Picbreeder</a> and adapted from the source code of David Ha`s <a href="https://blog.otoro.net/2015/07/31/neurogram/" target="_blank">Neurogram</a>. The drawing board was adapted from <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/harmony" target="_blank">Harmony</a>’s source code and the brushes <em>Sketchy</em>, <em>Shaded</em>, <em>Chrome</em>, <em>Fur</em>, <em>LongFur</em> and <em>Web</em> were first implemented in <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/" target="_blank">The Scribbler</a>.
